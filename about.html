        <div class="card">
            <p>
                I am a fresher and a Master of Computer Applications (MCA) student who is eager to
                learn, experiment, and grow as a software developer. I enjoy exploring different
                technologies and building practical projects that strengthen my understanding
                of real-world application development.
                <br><br>
                I have a strong interest in developing Android applications using Java, Kotlin,
                and Flutter, and I also enjoy creating responsive websites and software applications.
                Alongside this, I have gained exposure to AI and Machine Learning through academic
                and personal projects, which has helped me understand how intelligent systems
                can be applied to solve real problems.
